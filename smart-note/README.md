# Smart Note

a side project to make a note-like tool to help me in organizing my tasks over the day. Haven't looked up that there could be some tool out there that could provide me the functionality that I need, just felt the need for such thing so I built it.

***

## Features

#### (Added):
1. ..


#### (To be added):
1. whatsapp notifications as reminders
2. chatgpt or any other ai tool for quick questions and answers
3. speach to text
4. basic note functionality (notes, todos, drafts, scheduales, etc)

***

## if you want to use it

* `git clone https://github.com/A1iHassan/smart-note.git`
* `cd smart-note` or `set-location smart-note`
* `npm i`
* `npm run dev`
* Hold `ctrl` and click on the `http://localhost:5173/` that will appear in the terminal after the app runs

> Note: These steps will run the tool locally on your machine. for the current time, there is still no database set up for it, so it doesn't need any other tools with it.
In the future the service will be deployed, so you will be able to access it from the web.
